## Acknowledgements

The work at KTH involving different students and postdocs has been mainly financed by the European Research Council grant no. ERC-2013-CoG-616186, TRITOS and by the Swedish Research Council through different grants: VR 2014-5001 (outstanding your researcher to Luca Brandt) and Grant No. 2016-06119 (the multidisciplinary research environment INTERFACE, Hybrid multiscale modelling of transport phenomena for energy efficient processes). 
Computer time has been provided by SNIC (Swedish National Infrastructure for Computing) and by the National Infrastructure for High Performance Computing and Data Storage in Norway (project no. NN9561K).

As regards the GPU implementation, the authors would like to acknowledge the allocation IsC84_CANSGPU, provided at CINECA on MARCONI100, used during the code development. We would also like to thank the staff at CINECA, notably Massimiliano Guarrasi and Fabio Pitarri for their help in the development of the GPU functionalities at an early stage of the work.

We thank Francesco DeVita for the help with the implementation of the VoF MTHINC method.

We would also like to thank the researchers of NVIDIA among the [authors](AUTHORS.md), for the help provided in the GPU porting, ensuring that the code runs efficiently on many-GPU systems, and also for contributing to an improved software development workflow.
