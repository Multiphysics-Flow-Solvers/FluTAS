This case helps to validate the 2D lid driven cavity test against coarse, reliable, data (to ensure the test is fast enough).

Observables can be extracted directly from the binary files of y-velocity "data/vey_fld_000005000.bin".

We are interested in y-velocity over the z-directin along the domain centerline. To visualize it:

  * plot "data_ldc_re1000.txt" using 1:2
